# Contributing Guidelines

Collaboration is open in this repository! However, if you submit a pull request, please submit an issue first! This will allow the specific change to be evaluated as well as the purpose for the change. If the idea is valuable, but the solution maybe needs some work, this would allow new pull requests to be made to implement the same overall change!

There are a few guidelines, however:
- Adhere to the structure of this code. This is intended as a single-script program to enable easier adaption into bookmarklets or browser extensions.
- Be respectful in all interactions. This sort of goes without saying, but please do not say anything disrespectful to anyone here, and make sure all criticism is constructive.
- If an issue or pull request is closed, please do not get upset. Ultimately, this is my project, and while I welcome collaboration, if I find a specific feature request to be contrary to the purpose of this project or a pull request to be insufficient to solve a problem, I might disregard that specific issue/pull request. If this happens to you, feel free to continue collaborating! Your ideas are always welcomed!
